# Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering Final Project

This proyect is the final project of a bachelor's in Computer engineering graded a 99/100. It is an implementation of an Artificial Inteligence generator of notes of Lo-Fi music. It applys LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to provide temporal context.

Given a number x of seconds (duration of the song) and a number y of notes that should be played in the song (Each note has an offset of 1.5 between them by default so y should be greater than 1,2*x), it generates you a Lo-Fi song which contains a set of generated notes, a beat and ambient rain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
